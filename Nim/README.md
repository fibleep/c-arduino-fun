At the beginning, the player turns the potentiometer - after pressing a button the seed will be generated based on the potentiometer value.

Once the game is initialized, the player can play the game by using the buttons.

The goal of the game is to force the opponent into taking the last match from the stack.

BUTTON 1 -> DECREASE THE NUMBER OF MATCHES TO TAKE
BUTTON 2 -> END TURN - TAKE MATCHES
BUTTON 3 -> INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MATCHES TO TAKE

Once a turn is over, the player needs to press BUTTON 2 to proceed to the next turn.
